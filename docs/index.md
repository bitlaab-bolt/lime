**A definitive guide to Artificial Intelligence**

## What now

Machine learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning algorithms are typically categorized based on the learning style and the type of task they are designed to solve. The main types are:

**Supervised Learning**

In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from labeled data, where each input is paired with the correct output. It maps inputs to outputs based on the training data.

Common Algorithms:
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Neural Networks

Applications:
- Email spam detection
- Fraud detection
- Predictive analytics

**Unsupervised Learning**

Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data. The goal is to identify patterns, relationships, or structures in the input data.

Common Algorithms:
- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Autoencoders

Applications:
- Market segmentation
- Anomaly detection
- Recommendation systems

**Semi-Supervised Learning**

This is a hybrid approach that uses a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. It combines elements of supervised and unsupervised learning.

Common Algorithms:
- Self-training
- Label Propagation
- Graph-Based Methods

Applications:
- Medical imaging
- Speech analysis

**Reinforcement Learning**

Reinforcement learning focuses on training agents to make sequences of decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent learns by trial and error to maximize a reward signal.

Common Algorithms:

- Deep Q-Networks (DQN)
- Policy Gradient Methods
- Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

Applications:

**Evolutionary Algorithms**

These algorithms mimic natural evolution to optimize problems by evolving solutions over generations.

Common Techniques:
- Genetic Algorithms
- Differential Evolution
- Evolutionary Strategies

Applications:
- Optimization problems
- Automated design

**Ensemble Learning**

Ensemble methods combine multiple models to improve overall performance.

Common Techniques:
- Bagging (e.g., Random Forests)
- Boosting (e.g., AdaBoost, XGBoost)
- Stacking

Applications:
- Sentiment analysis
- Forecasting

**Dimensionality Reduction**

These algorithms reduce the number of features in a dataset while retaining important information.

Common Techniques:

- t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
- Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

Applications:
- Data visualization
- Feature extraction
